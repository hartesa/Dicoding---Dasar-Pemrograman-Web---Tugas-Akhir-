Saiyuki: Journey West is a PlayStation strategy RPG adaption of the Chinese novel, Journey to the West. The Japanese name is Saiyuki (西遊記) which is the Japanese pronunciation of the novel's title. The character designer is Akihiro Yamada.

Due to the open gender of Xuanzang commonly found in Japanese translations of the original novel, the hero can either be male or female. Choosing to play as either gender does not change the overall story, though causes minor alterations to the dialogue. <br><br>

            Genjo, a sixteen year old monk, was raised in Gold Temple without
            knowing his/her real parents. One day, Genjo had a dream of Lady
            Kannon, who bestowed a staff to the youth. She told the monk to seek
            the assistance of divine Guardians and deliver the staff to Thunder
            Temple in India. Once an Emperor's messenger visits the temple with
            a similar order, Genjo is appointed as the temple's representative.
            Donning a proper monk's garb, Genjo dons the name "Sanzo", and
            begins his/her journey with two escorts. Along the way, Sanzo loses
            his/her guards and frees Goku from his boulder prison. Gaining
            his/her first companion, Sanzo continues his/her travels while
            guarding the staff he/she carries from several entities. Gameplay
            Overview Saiyuki: Journey West, plays in a similar manner as Fu-Qi's
            Fengshen Yanyi, often being considered its spiritual sucessor. The
            overworld map is shown in a similar manner and training spots have
            been adjusted to dojos in select towns. Players now have the choice
            to select their next destination. 
            <br><br>
            Battles take place on a 3D
            isometric map with animated 2D sprites, very reminiscent of Final
            Fantasy Tactics. Turns are determined by the speed of each character
            present, and each action is determined by a length of squares.
            Treasure boxes can be found on the field, containing a variety of
            different items, ranging from simple consumables to powerful
            equipment; the latter is often found in hidden or well protected
            treasure chests. Players can interact with certain parts of the
            environment, such as dropping log bridges and stepping on elevators.
            Unlike in Fengshen Yanyi, the ability to shape the land has been
            removed and it is replaced with a few new features to separate the
            titles. Elemental Attributes Each character has one assigned
            element. This attribute determines the strengths and weaknesses for
            the individual, as well as their proficiency with spells of a
            particular elemental attribute for spells and other abilities. 
            <br><br>
            The
            five elements are Fire, Wood (Life in game), Metal (Gold in game),
            Earth (Dirt in game) and Water. Taking advantage of an element's
            weakness can increase or decrease the damage a party member can
            deal, and may additionally award more experience for each character.
            The following lists the element chain present in the game. Dirt
            defeats Water; Water defeats Fire; Fire defeats Gold; Gold defeats
            Life; Life defeats Dirt. Wereform and Guardians Every party member
            but Sanzo has the ability to shapeshift into a massive beastial
            form, dubbed Wereform. Only one Wereform can be active on the field
            at at a time. The duration of their transformation, in turns, is
            dictated by the length of the Were Gauge, located at the upper left
            corner of the screen. One bar is needed to transform, and the rest
            is used for attacks, which guzzles a preset amount of bars from the
            Were Gauge. Players can earn experience while in this state to level
            up the Were Gauge to increase its size, as well unlock more powerful
            abilities. Wereform attacks can destroy certain obstacles which may
            reveal hidden treasures or new walking paths for characters.
            <br><br>
            Transformed characters cannot be healed through common means but
            gain a substantial boost in life points, as well total immunity to
            all negative status effects. Sanzo's counterpart to the Wereforms is
            their ability to summon the Guardians they've collected during the
            story. These Guardians require magic points to bring into the field
            but each comes with their unique, no-cost abilities. Sanzo can only
            summon one Guardian at a time, and each lasts for a maximum of three
            of Sanzo's turns. Each Guardian has unique passive effects to
            separate one from the other, that affects Sanzo and/or the party.
            Mother - Life element, can attack in a two square radius; restores
            party HP per turn; Warrior - Gold element, can attack in a two
            square radius; increases physical defense; Fool - Fire element, has
            a linear attack; increases physical offense; Luna - Dirt element,
            attacks with a bow's range; restores party MP per turn (except for
            Sanzo's); Cavalier - Water element, hits in a one square area near
            Sanzo; increases movement and allows Sanzo to float; Emperor - No
            element, attacks in a three square radius from Sanzo; grants the
            passive effects from all the other Guardians. 
            <br><br>
            Towns and Equipment
            Towns can be visited during the journey, and each has at least a
            store, for equipment and spells, and a chemist, for healing items.
            Some villages may have a dojo for training sessions marked with
            Beginner, Advanced or Master Difficulty. Dojo sessions are free
            level grinding, except that Wereforms cannot be used. By defeating
            the Dojo Master on the Master Difficulty, the player gets a dojo
            license; by collecting them all the player is awarded with a special
            prize. Characters keep the same weapons throughout the game, but can
            improve them by visiting blacksmiths found in certain towns. Sanzo
            is the exception; their staff can only be improved by acquiring
            Guardians. Larger cities have Posts, a building that offers
            part-time jobs and monetary awards. Certain side-quests given by the
            Posts involve fighting, which the player may use as an opportunity
            to increase their Were Gauge. Posts also offer an optional card
            mini-game. The player starts by purchasing medals from the dealer.
            Bet on the card stack with highest single digit number to win.
            Medals can be exchanged for unique prizes, and each card dealer has
            their own set of items. Extras and Localization differences Game
            extras include Sanzo's diary from the main screen and the bonus
            section unlocked when the game is cleared once. The Japanese version
            has characters speak with limited audio clips during cutscenes and
            battle. The staff roll movie is different in both languages. Voices
            are omitted in the English version.
